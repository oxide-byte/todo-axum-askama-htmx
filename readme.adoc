= TODO - AXUM - ASKAMA - HTMX

== Introduction

This is a simple Todo app, as POC for HTMX example based on Askama template engine and running on an Axum server. The Tower crates serves the static resources files like CSS, JS...

The application contains the basic CRUD elements including the create/update handled by a modal window.

As bonus, the POC uses Tailwind to prettify the application. You can use the standalone version of Tailwind or install NodeJs and NPM.
